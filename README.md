# lineage-switch
Unofficial LineageOS 17.1 (Android 10) builds for the Nintendo Switch. Official Switchroot builds are available [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-switchroot-android-10.4229761/).

These builds are signed with my own keys, so a clean flash is required if coming from/to official/other builds. Just extract the zip file in your SD card's root and follow the instructions in the official thread above.
