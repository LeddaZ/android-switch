# lineage-switch
Unofficial LineageOS 17.1 (Android 10) builds for the Nintendo Switch. Official Switchroot builds are available [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-switchroot-android-10.4229761/).

These builds are signed with my own keys, so a clean flash is required if coming from/to official/other builds.

Steps:
- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/LeddaZ/lineage-switch/releases/latest)
- For standard Android, extract `tab.zip` to the SD card root and copy `lineage-17.1-XXXXXXXX-UNOFFICIAL-icosa_sr-signed.zip` to the same location
- For Android TV, extract `atv.zip` to the SD card root and copy `lineage-17.1-XXXXXXXX-UNOFFICIAL-icosa_tv_sr-signed.zip` to the same location
- Then follow the instructions in the official XDA thread above
