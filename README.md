# lineage-switch
Unofficial LineageOS 17.1 builds (based on Android 10) for the Nintendo Switch. Official Switchroot Android 10 builds are available [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-switchroot-android-10.4229761/).

Builds are signed with my own keys, so a clean flash is required if coming from/to official/other builds.

## Steps
- Download `icosa-tab-XXXXXXXX-dev.zip` (Standard Android) or `icosa-atv-XXXXXXXX-dev.zip` (Android TV) from the [Releases](https://github.com/LeddaZ/lineage-switch/releases/latest) section.
- Extract the zip file's contents to the SD card root.
- If you want GApps, I recommend [OpenGApps](https://opengapps.org/) (use ARM64 10.0 pico, or tvmini for Android TV).
- If you want root, download the latest version of [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/latest).
- Follow the flashing instructions [here](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Android/Setup-10#steps) (from step 5 onwards).

To update, download `lineage-17.1-XXXXXXXX-UNOFFICIAL-icosa_sr.zip` (standard Android) or `lineage-17.1-XXXXXXXX-UNOFFICIAL-icosa_tv_sr.zip` (Android TV) and flash it in TWRP. You can also update from Settings -> System -> Updater (supported on September 2021 builds and newer).
